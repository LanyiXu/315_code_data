Notes for Tennis Data (Player Edition)

This data set is a transformation of the original dataset. Instead of game oriented, this dataset is player oriented. For each player we list all games, their opponent and whether the player won or lost (`WinLoss`) and the standard summary information, switching from the "Winner"/"Loser" paradigm to a "Player"/"Opponent" paradigm. As such you'll find twice as many observations in this dataset as the original (2 players per game).
