This data consists of the percentage composition of 8 fatty acids (palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic,
linolenic, arachidic, eicosenoic) found in the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils. (An analysis of this data is
given in (Forina, Armanino, Lanteri & Tiscornia 1983)). There are 9 collection areas, 4 from southern Italy
(North and South Apulia, Calabria, Sicily), two from Sardinia (Inland and Coastal) and 3 from northern
Italy (Umbria, East and West Liguria).
The data available are:
Region South, North or Sardinia
Area Sub-regions within the larger regions (North and South Apulia,
Calabria, Sicily, Inland and Coastal Sardinia, Umbria, East and
West Liguria
Palmitic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Palmitoleic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Stearic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Oleic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Linoleic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Linolenic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Arachidic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
Eicosenoic Acid Percentage ×100 in sample
The primary question is “How do we distinguish the oils from different regions and areas in Italy based
on their combinations of the fatty acids?”
